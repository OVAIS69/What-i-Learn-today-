# Prompt GPT

A minimal, fast, and responsive website for browsing a large library of AI prompts. This site is built with pure frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to be easily deployable on services like GitHub Pages.

### Features
-   **Dynamic Content:** Prompts are loaded from a `prompts.json` file.
-   **Instant Search:** A search bar filters prompts in real-time as you type.
-   **Category Filter:** A dropdown menu allows you to filter prompts by category.
-   **Copy to Clipboard:** A convenient button on each prompt card lets you copy the prompt text with a single click.
-   **Light/Dark Mode:** A toggle button switches between a clean light theme and a modern dark theme.
-   **Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts to provide an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

### Deployment on GitHub Pages
1.  **Repository:** Upload all files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `prompts.json`, and `README.md`) to a new GitHub repository.
2.  **Settings:** Go to your repository's **Settings** tab.
3.  **Pages:** In the left-hand menu, click on **Pages**.
4.  **Source:** Under the "Build and deployment" section, select "Deploy from a branch".
5.  **Branch:** Choose the branch containing your code (e.g., `main` or `master`) and save.

Your website will be live at `https://[your-username].github.io/[your-repository-name]`.
