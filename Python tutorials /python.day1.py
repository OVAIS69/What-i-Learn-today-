1. "Hello, World!" Program
The "Hello, World!" program is the classic starting point for learning any programming language. It simply prints the phrase "Hello, World!" to the console. This program teaches you how to use the print() function.

print("Hello, World!")

Explanation:
print() is the function.
"Hello, World!" is a string. A string is just a sequence of characters enclosed in either single (') or double (") quotes.
The print() function takes this string and displays it as output.
2: Variables
Variables are like containers for storing data. You can give a variable a name and assign a value to it using the = sign. The beauty of Python is that you don't need to specify the data type (like integer or string) when you create a variable; Python figures it out automatically.

2. Storing a String in a Variable

message = "Welcome to the world of Python!"
print(message)

Explanation:
We created a variable named message.
We assigned the string "Welcome to the world of Python!" to this variable.
When we call print(message), Python retrieves the value stored in the message variable and displays it.
You can also store numbers in variables:

my_age = 25
print(my_age)

3: Simple Arithmetic
Python can perform mathematical calculations.
x = 10
y = 5

# Addition
sum = x + y
print("Sum:", sum)

# Subtraction
difference = x - y
print("Difference:", difference)

# Multiplication
product = x * y
print("Product:", product)

# Division
quotient = x / y
print("Quotient:", quotient)
Explanation:
We created two variables, x and y, and assigned them integer values.
We then used the +, -, *, and / operators to perform calculations.
The print() function can display multiple items at once by separating them with a comma. It automatically adds a space between the items.
